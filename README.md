MediBook is an online appointment system for doctors. The system consists of a website designed for doctors and patients and an administrative panel that manages the website. Only administrators and managers of medical institutions have access to the panel.
The system considers all the key points and scenarios during the appointment and consultation process. It allows the system to be used for making an appointment at a medical facility and for online consultations using third-party video conferencing software.
A user-friendly interface was developed and the ability to effectively search, view, and filter specialists was implemented.
